Many people get confused between IVF, IUI, and ICSI. These are all fertility treatments but used for different problems.

IUI means Intrauterine Insemination. It is the simplest one. In this, the doctor takes washed sperm and puts it inside the womanâ€™s uterus during her ovulation time. It's helpful when the sperm count is a little low or if the couple has no clear fertility issue. Itâ€™s less expensive but the success rate is also lower, around 15%â€“20% per cycle.

IVF, or In-Vitro Fertilization, is more advanced. Here, womanâ€™s eggs are taken out, mixed with sperm in a lab, and then the embryo is put inside her uterus. This is good when there is blocked fallopian tubes, older age, or failed IUI. IVF success rate is higher, especially for women below 35.

ICSI is like IVF, but more focused. In ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection), one healthy sperm is injected directly into one egg. Itâ€™s used when sperm count or quality is very poor. This gives a higher chance of fertilization.

So, IUI is for mild problems, IVF is for bigger issues, and ICSI is for sperm-related issues. Cost also increases in that order.
